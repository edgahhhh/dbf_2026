# Overview: Preliminary Design

Makeshift documentation from preliminary design process

## Ground Run

Overall, a good ground run is somewhere between 15-20m, where acceleration is small enough to ignore transient effects, and the performance isn't affected.

From observing different ground runs and how performance was effected, the following results were come to.

1. Ground run may affect how many laps you can achieve, but only at large ground runs (> 40 m)
2. Acceleration linearizes after about 15m of ground run distance
3. Energy and power only affected when take off is the constraining factor (< 15m)

## Propeller Analysis

Found a good bunch of propellers that seem to be great for banner towing.

Need to address some issues:

1. Propellers are at their saturation points, due to low advance ratio

2. Not stitching rpm data together
