# DBF 2026

Author: Edgar Hernandez

## Overview

This is my own repository to store files from the design process for DBF as part of the University of Texas at El Paso.

**If you're not from UTEP, hi, also since DBF is my spare time thing (if that even exists) and I'm always developing here and doing all sorts of unorganized stuff, this repo is not kept up very well. So good luck here.**

## Setup

If anything is developed in matlab, run setup.m to set up paths. Though at the moment of writing there isn't much matlab use cases.
